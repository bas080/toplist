# Top List

No databases, just localStorage and URLs.

The whole deal with this project is the list that is named the _top list_.
The top list is the list at the top of all lists.

You can add new items to this list in several ways.

- Use the add item form at the top of that list.
- Click on an item that is in one of the archived lists.
- Open a share link and add the items shared with you into your top list.

## Features

### Create a clean top list

At any time you can start a new top list. The current one is moved to archived
and can no longer be edited.

> If you wish to have multiple top lists you can achieve this by using
> multiple browser profiles or different browsers. Considering supporting
> multiple _named_ top lists.

### Share your lists with others

At any time you can create a link of your top list and share. The person that
opens this link is prompted to pick the items they want in their top list.

### Merge previously archived lists

You can bring back items of an archived list using the same method as the
sharing url.

### Print your top list

TBD: Comes with styles for printing your top list in a readable manner.

## Applications

You can use this for all kinds of things.

### Shopping list

Start adding items to your top list and have your mom add items to her own top
list. When you're ready to go to the shop ask your mom to share her top list
and merge it into your list.

### TODO list

Create TODO lists and share them with others. Once you've done a task you can
remove the item from the list. You can re-use the share link to re-add the
items again to your top list.

### Exercise plan

Keep track of your exercises you have done in the past and ones you are
planning to do next time.

## Road-map

### List share actions

As someone that imports a list
i would like to be able to pick how to import it
so that I have granular control over what happens to my top list.

### Add username to list items

A user name is generated on first time visit and optionally edited. This
username is assigned to every list item. That way it is possible to derive the
author of the list item. This enables features like submitting talking points
during retrospectives.
